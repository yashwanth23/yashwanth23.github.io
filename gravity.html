				<div><p class="rajdhani">Taking a random stroll on the streets, jumping out of joy, lifting objects from the ground  -  these are the activities that we take for granted but little do we understand the role gravity plays in such actions. Gravity is a natural phenomenon in which objects with masses tend to attract each other when kept at a distance. While we seldom observe its presence in our daily lives, we are bound by it as it is one of the fundamental forces of physics.  This project is an attempt to demonstrate the concept of gravity through a video. This was shot at my appartment when I tried to get rid of my old mattress, I took advantage of gravity to reduce my workload of carrying the mattress all the way down by simply letting dowm the mattress on the steps which are at steep angle. </p></div>
